Machine learning is when you feed data into a machine (mathematical data model) 
 and get results out based on some models
 one example would be feeding pictures of cats and dogs and labelling them
 when the machine learns, we can give it a new never before seen picture of a dog or cats
 and it'll be able to identify unclassified pictures whether it's a dog or a cat
 no telling the computer "a cat has pointy ears"


3 major types of machine learning:
1.) Supervised learning
classic example is the dog and cat
whenever we have already classified data / data that already contains the solution
we're giving supervision to the model so that it figures out what it's looking at

2.) Unsupervised learning
we provide data that isn't classified, 
for example we look at a graph of weight in respect to height and we have data points on the graph
the data points aren't classified, no saying "these are skinny" "these are overweight"
and we tell the model "find some clusters/patterns"
it can't tell us whether it's an overweight group but it can tell us this is one clusters
if we labeled the dots for which are overweight which are skinny that would become a supervised moder

3.) Reinforcement
entirelly different, it works with agents and environments
we have the ground as an environment and a person as an agent 
we give the model the goal of the agent/person jumping as high as possible
we don't tell the model how to perform the action we just reward it for performing it
we start with random actions, for walking left to right you get 0 points
if you go down to the group you receive -2 points
if you jump and reach a greater height you're rewarded moder
reinforcement learning has a lot to do with genetic algorithms and evolution
